**Tes has a Master’s degree in International Relations. He loves football, cooking, music and history. He has a contagious sense of humour and is very sociable.**

He is also an asylum seeker. Tes ­– short for Tesfabrhan – arrived in Middlesbrough six months back after a long journey from Eritrea. Far from home and everything he knew, he needed friends.

Investing in People and Culture, our partner on Teesside, referred Tes to us. We matched him with Judith, a retired head teacher with a deep interest in Africa.

Time spent living and working in Uganda and Ghana in the past has taught her what it’s like to be an outsider, as she explains to BBC Radio Teesside in this <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LJ6Gy4vtqF3Y_4L11-IXT442iFMVEIA/view?usp=sharing)>interview ></a> with her and Tes.

“In Ghana, I was the only white person living in this small town,” she says. “So I kind of had an insight of being in a strange place and knowing nobody.”

It turned out well for Judith though, because of the warmth and kindness of the local community. “I was so well received and people were very friendly,” she recalls.

The experience made her want to reciprocate by making someone feel welcome here in the UK in turn. “When I saw this project advertised I thought, yes, that’s something I would definitely like to do. Turning up somewhere where you know nobody, it must be just petrifying.”

Middlesbrough houses a disproportionately high number of refugees and asylum seekers and Judith, who was born and raised in the town, feels that her community has done a great job in providing a welcome. She says:

> ***“I am proud of the way my town has assimilated refugees and asylum seekers so successfully."***

Although she and Tes were only introduced by HostNation North-East seven weeks ago, they are already off to a great start. “It feels like seven years!” exclaims Tes. “We really chat open-heartedly about everything. The befriending scheme…really made a difference in my life, like I could easily adjust to my life here.”

The two of them always seem to have lots to talk about and Tes is very curious about all aspects of British life and history. He is keen to be part of and contribute to his new community. When the BBC reporter asks him if he feels at home now, he bursts out irrepressibly:

“Way, way better than the way I was when I arrived here!” And, echoing the popular local chant much heard at football matches and live concerts, Tes adds: 

> ***“I feel a bit like a T-T-Teessider!”***

Judith is getting a lot from the friendship herself, as she explains: “I’ve really enjoyed it and I’m glad that it’s been beneficial. I felt that it would be – it’s what people need in a new setting. I think it’s a really lovely thing to do.”

So, to Judith and Tes, all of us wish you a long and happy friendship, and a swift, positive outcome for Tes’s asylum process.
