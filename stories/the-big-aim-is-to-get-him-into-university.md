title: The big aim is to get him into university
---
John (London befriender, male, 20s) works full-time as an analyst in London but taught maths and English to Afghan refugees while a student and later lived in Beirut getting to know a number of Syrian refugees. John and Amin (Syrian refugee, male, 20s) have a lot in common.

John has been very supportive, meeting Amin every week for several hours to help him with English and reading science articles together in preparation for his university application. It paid off and Amin is now at a top UK University studying engineering.

JOHN on AMIN:

> ***It’s going really well. I’m with him once a week as we have been from the beginning. We do a lot of reading together. His English is getting a lot better. He’s more confident. The big aim is to get him into university. He’s a very, very nice guy I couldn’t be more thankful to you guys for setting us up.***

AMIN on JOHN:

> ***John is speechless good personality and also amazing teacher. This is best way to learn to be fluent in English.***
