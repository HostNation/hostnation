Watch some of our HostNation refugee friends share what home means to them in this short film made for World Refugee Day by the Council of Europe as part of their [Intercultural Cities programme](https://www.coe.int/en/web/interculturalcities/world-refugee-day-2021).  \
We all need a friend to make us feel at home.
