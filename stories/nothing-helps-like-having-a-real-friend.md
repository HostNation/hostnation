title: Nothing helps like having a real friend
---
**Sue (London befriender, female, 50s) and Layla (Iranian refugee, female, 60s) hit it off immediately. Sue was really impressed and inspired by Layla.** 

They live close by. Sue dropped off gifts during lockdown when they couldn’t see each other and called regularly. They missed seeing each other and resumed face-to-face as soon as they could.

SUE on LAYLA: 

> ***It’s crazy! The woman is incredible, she is so personable, she knows so many people, I wish I met her 100 years ago, we are such good friends, We see each other as equals, total acceptance, respect and warmth, we have the same outlook on life. She made me a beautiful Iranian meal and I was humbled. I never expected it to be so much fun. It was meant to be.***

LAYLA on SUE: 

> ***Nothing helps like having a real friend. I feel like I’ve known her for ages. It is important the warmth your host gives you. She is the most valuable thing I have in this country. I told my family in Iran about her. I’m not strange in this country anymore, I have a friend in this country. It makes me optimistic about the future. I don’t feel I’m lonely, I’m not homesick and life is more interesting. She is like a sister. She doesn’t judge me.***
