#### Rebecca (HostNation befriender) and her refugee friend, Pinar, appeared in a new podcast series ‘A Friend Indeed’ in an episode called 'friendship that crosses cultures' to talk about what their relationship means to them. Thank you Rebecca and Pinar for being so honest and eloquent!  The podcast also features our founder, Anneke, describing the work of HostNation.
