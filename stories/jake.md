HostNation was founded in 2017 to offer friendship and social opportunities to asylum seekers and refugees. We wanted to give refugees – who are often very isolated – a way into our society through the kindness of local residents.

Our founder, Anneke Elwes, was experienced in befriending refugees and knew there were many altruistic people willing to step up. So HostNation was born: a digital platform for matching friendly locals to lonely refugees, which has fast become a wide family of flourishing social connections.

We gained charitable status in 2018 and a network of refugee referrers are now alerting us to refugees in need of friendship in London and across the north-east of England.

We are a CIO registered with the Charity Commission. Charity no. 1180004
