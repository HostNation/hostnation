          HostNation recognise that whilst asylum seekers and refugees over the
          age of 18 are not technically classified in legal terms as vulnerable
          adults many of them are nevertheless vulnerable. The form is both a
          screening and a profiling questionnaire and for this reason requests a
          lot of personal information.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          You will need to upload some documents as ID as well as provide us
          with two references. We need these for safeguarding purposes but all
          personal information and documents will be data protected and will not
          be shared with others. Once the information has been submitted and
          references checked, someone from the team will contact you to discuss
          befriending.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          We also ask you to commit to reading the befriending guide which has a
          lot of information on seeking asylum in the UK, the problems many
          asylum seekers and refugees encounter, how the system works, best
          practice befriending, boundaries, signposting to specialist support
          services etc.

        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          We ask for an initial commitment of three months, during which we suggest a weekly face to face meet up and regular phone contact. This is your opportunity to show your befriendee around,
          introduce them to free activities and help them participate more in UK
          life. Theyâ€™ll have the chance to get to know a friendly local and
          practise their English. And you may find a real friend in the process!

        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          HostNation is an introductory service putting socially isolated asylum
          seekers, refugees and migrants in need of friendship, in contact with
          local, volunteer befrienders offering friendship. We aim to create
          interactions between two different populations (UK residents and those
          seeking refuge) who have problems intersecting, but we cannot
          recommend anyone on the site to you. This is an altruistic, social
          arrangement, not a contractual obligation and there is no payment nor
          are volunteer befrienders expected to provide any professional
          services.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          We try to manage the expectations of refugees referred to HostNation
          and help them to understand that befrienders commit to meeting their
          befriendee socially once every week or two weeks over a period of 3
          months. We will also explain that befrienders are not social workers,
          case workers or legal experts and cannot help with the progress of
          asylum claims or housing applications but may be able to help their
          befriendee access expert support should it be needed. For information
          on the role of the befriender please read the Befrienders Guide.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          HostNation is not responsible for verifying the accuracy of
          information given by befrienders or referrers. We will do what we can
          to ensure a successful match but cannot guarantee that friendship will
          emerge. We are not making recommendations or any representations about
          the suitability or appropriateness of any relationship that arises
          either directly or indirectly through the use of the website.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          Whilst we will help to arrange the first meeting, HostNation cannot
          take responsibility for managing the continuing relationship between
          befriender and befriendee. Support after the initial meeting is
          limited; further meet ups are arranged directly between befriender and
          befriendee. HostNation will check on the status of the relationship at
          1 month and 3 month intervals. During the three months, befrienders
          can contact HostNation with any queries or concerns and we will do our
          best to respond as quickly as we can, but we are unable to provide a
          full support service.
