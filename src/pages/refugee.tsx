          Do you want a local friend to chat to and find out more about life
          here in the UK? Itâ€™s a great way to practice your English and explore
          new places. It can be lots of fun.

          84% of our refugee friends say they felt better, more positive and

          How HostNation works
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          We help refugees and asylum seekers find a local friend to help settle
          into the UK. We will introduce you online, then you will chat on the
          phone once a week at first.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          When you are both ready, and if Covid rules allow, you can meet face
          to face for outings to places like local cafes, parks, markets or
          museums.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          You both start with a promise to be in touch for three months. But
          many friendships go so well that they continue for years!

        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          You need someone to refer you to us. This might be your social worker,
          caseworker, lawyer, therapist or teacher. We need a person who knows
          you and can tell us this is the right service for you.

          Then we will contact you to find out more about you and who you would
          like to meet. We try to make a good match with one of the people on
          our database, who we have checked carefully. They are called your
          befriender.
        </Txt>
        <Txt style={styles.boxText}>
          We always match women with women. If you are a man, we may match you
          to a male or a female. This is because we have more female befrienders
          on our list.
